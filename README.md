Here is a summary of all the details of my projects so far!

### Data visualization [Oct 2024]
#### Introduction 
In this unit, I explored the critical role of data visualization in analyzing large datasets to enhance understanding of business challenges and inform decision-making processes. Data visualization serves as a universal language, enabling viewers to uncover patterns and relationships within data, thus facilitating effective communication of business issues both internally and externally.

#### Expected Learning outcmes: 
- Learn fundementals of visualizations
- Learn how to effectively visualize data
- Engage in self reflection

 #### How Iâ€™ve applied these concepts in practice

The activities paired with self reflection really made me aware of where I stood in terms of my own development 

### Unit 1-2 
Learned objectives:
- Focused on understanding the fundamentals of idioms and grammer by participating in a collaborative discussion. 
- The comparison done by my peers hekped me expand my learning to see different perspectives.

### Unit 3-4-5 
Learned Objectives : 
- Exploring R & python : data writing and reading
- Understanding how plotly is used for graphs

#### Python using VS code

#### R using R studio 

- Some of the graphs I was able to achieve using R

In conclusion I was able to do all my visualizations in R regardless of being new to it, I explored a lot of readings to understand wo to personalize charts and make them some of my key references were from the Book 
- Title: An introduction to statistical learning, with applications in R by James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T. & Tibshirani, R

As well as youtube course of R:

#### Unit 5 
Learned Objectives: 

- Understanding the process of EDA
- Working with code for regressions and understanding different tests that we can run on data 

During the seminar of the project important concepts were grasped to help understand the goals for visualizations

#### Unit 9 - 10 - 11

Learned Objectives 

- Designing Dashboard
- Understanding the effeciency of creating dashboard
- Storytelling with data

### Introduction 
During the course of these weeks I had a perspective shift when i looked at data I started noticing how a lot of different aspects of data not just a numbers one can be visualized to display trends. I tried to go a through an un traditional route to by choosing a Dataset involving reviews. 

### understanding Tableau 
I was able to operate tableau by running Covid 19 Statistics and deriving visualizations for practice: 

### Opportunities and key practices 
Despite exploring tableau I opted to go for dashbaord in Power BI. I managed to replicate all of the vsiualizations in Tablaeu as well and look forward to further exploring it. 

Moreover, in order to manage my time more effeciently I plan to follow Parkinsons Law which states: 
- setting deadlines
- breaking tasks down into smaller achievable goals
- setting time limit for tasks
- prioritizing tasks based on urgency

To manage my workload I have implemented the parkinsons law to ensure all my work is done in a manner that allows me to manage my workload effectively.


#### Unit 12
Learned objectives 

- Self reflection
- Understanding fundamental role virtual reality can play when it comes to Data visualization was able to run a demo to understand the impact
